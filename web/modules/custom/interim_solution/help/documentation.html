  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This document explains how to work with the Interim Solution section.</p>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>You have to fill out this information in the Finding aid form, so the
    system searches for its assets in the Catalog:</p>

  <h2>Routes</h2>
  <h3>Interim Solution Settings</h3>
  <p>It is on <code>/admin/config/interim-solution/settings</code></p>
  <img src="&path&image2.png" alt="Interim Solution Settings">

  <p>If you check "Automatic Switch" option, you won't have to approve the
    Finding aids' Asset from Catalog to show them to the users.</p>
  <p>You have to add an email address to get a notification when a Finding aid
    has assets in the Catalog. If this text field is empty, it won't send any
    email.</p>

  <h3>Interim Solution Report</h3>
  <p>It can find on <code>/admin/reports/interim-solution</code></p>
  <img src="&path&image3.png" alt="Interim Solution Report">
  <p>It gives some information about the Interim Solution.</p>

  <h3>Finding Aids</h3>
  <p>You can find it on <code>/admin/content/finding_aids</code></p>
  <img src="&path&image4.png" alt="Finding Aids">
  <p>Here you can delete the Medias associated with the Finding aids that have
    assets in the catalog, and they were approved by a content editor.</p>
  <p>The red color is for the contents that you cannot delete because they do
    not meet the conditions to that.</p>
  <p>All administrators can access these routes, but you can give permission to
    other users to access them.</p>

  <h2>Queues</h2>
  <p>There are two background processes in Drupal which are checking if there is
    Finding aids with assets in the Catalog. The first one is for newly Finding
    aids created, it searches if there are assets in the Catalog, and the second
    one is responsible for finding updates that info when they already have
    assets in there.</p>
